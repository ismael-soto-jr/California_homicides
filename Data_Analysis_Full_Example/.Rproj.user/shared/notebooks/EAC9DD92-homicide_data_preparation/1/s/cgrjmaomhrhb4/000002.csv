"1"," ""PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. \n\nIt is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample.

Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets.
